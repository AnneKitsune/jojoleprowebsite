The Lost of Time
================================================================================
An opiniated essay on work, desires and autonomy.



--- Everything together
- less desires unlocks simplicity. simplicity gives you autonomy and reduces 
work. autonomy gives you control.
- if you value yourself, you should value taking care of yourself 
(where you can!). who's better positioned to take care of you than yourself?
- if you can't take care of yourself for some things (disabilities), be
grateful that someone else can.
- if you can take care of others while still taking care of yourself first, do
it. we are all human and in this together. we all want to be happy.

Work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- we don't have time for ourselves in moderns society
- specialization, or how to create time.
- specialization as an economics basis.
- logically, we should have more time due to specialization, so why isn't it
case? where did it go? where was it lost?

Do you ever feel like you are doing so so much and are always busy, yet have no
real control over your life?

If so, congratulations! You are normal!

Society has been and is still going down a route where we trade personal control
in favor of comfort and ease.

Economically, it makes sense to do so. Specialization is more efficient than
doing everything yourself. So, it makes sense to give up control over mundane 
tasks so you can focus on other things taking a lot of time.

Why spend hours each day preparing food, washing clothes and gardening when you
can have society do it for you and instead put in less hours of work in a 
specialized job?

From a cold, logical perspective, it makes perfect sense.
Specialization, under this model, *creates* time.

However, this works because of a few assumptions.
First of all, you expect that you will always be able to convert your hours of
work into real, tangible material items or services.
Secondly, you expect that the hours you put into the specialized job will be
lower than the hours you would have to put to get what you want.
Finally, specialization exists primarily for the same reason economics theories 
exist; because we are trying to resolve a problem of satisfying infinite desires
with limited resources.

We will explore those in the rest of this essay.
One final remark before we dive in: If specialization creates time, why do we
still *feel* like we have less and less of it?


Desires
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- the economy of desires
- economics, satisfying infinite desires with limited resources
- the creation of desires, too much desires to satisfy them all
- having less desires makes it so you can satisfy those that are important

As said in the previous chapter, the economy tries to solve the problem of
satisfying infinite desires with limited resources.

It does so without changing the conditions of the problem.

Society encourages following your desires. It makes sense, its good for
business. They get to sell you things. Everything works, kind of, for a while,
at least until we run out of resources.

I'm not saying we should repress our desires, but that we should choose with
more care which one we want to pursue.
Effectively, by not pursuing infinite desires, we are changing the rules of the
game.

North western society is plagued by an epidemy of desires. Most people want so 
much things that they can't ever satisfy all of them. Such people keep wanting
and wanting, which prevents them from being properly happy for what they have.

What has to be done is painfully obvious: focus on your primary desires and stop
pursuing those that are not worth your time and attention.
Not doing this has for consequence something affecting society at an
unprecedented scale: a loss of autonomy.

Autonomy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In computer science, there are two very important and simple concepts that
indicate very strongly the quality of a program.
Cohesion and coupling.
Programs are composed of multiple semi-independent units

- coupling and cohesion, two very well known concepts in computer science.
- giving up power for comfort
- you can't be fully autonomous, its a best effort and always has been
- making lists of long term desires
- making lists of tasks that are in line with your long term desires
- knowledge, the reward of free time
- autonomy, the reward of organisation
- you should ask for help when you need it, but also avoid depending on others
- simplicity kill efficiency of complexity.
- simplicity is absolutely awesome for solving problems. (if your problem aren't
overly complex)
- stoicism: if you don't have control over it, don't worry about it.
- stoicism: if you *do* have control and are worrying, plan action.
- society's services survival is out of your control. your survival is.
