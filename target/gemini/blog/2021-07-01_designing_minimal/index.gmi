## Designing Minimal: Or how to complete projects
In this blog post, I will give you a method that will allow you to quickly
complete projects. Ready? Go!

### Define what complete means!
You can't complete a project if you don't know when to call it complete.
Make a list of requirements where once they are all reached, the project is
completed.

### Design small!
Big projects are often just a collection of smaller projects glued together.
Often, people will keep those projects in the same repository.
The issue with this is it becomes hard to reason about which sub-project is
completed and what are the missing requirements for the others.

For this reason, split up your projects into *small and separated* projects that
have a clear *list of requirements for completion*.

An added benefit is that you avoid feature creep, where more and more features
get added and the project can never "be completed".

## Conclusion
If you want to complete projects, split it into smaller projects that each have
a clear end goal.
